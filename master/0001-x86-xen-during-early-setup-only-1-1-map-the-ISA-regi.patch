Subject: [PATCH] x86/xen: during early setup, only 1:1 map the ISA region

During early setup, when the reserved regions and MMIO holes are being
setup as 1:1 in the p2m, clear any mappings instead of making them 1:1
(execept for the ISA region which is expected to be mapped).

This fixes a regression introduced in 3.5 by 83d51ab473dd (xen/setup:
update VA mapping when releasing memory during setup) which caused
hosts with tboot to fail to boot.

tboot marks a region in the e820 map as unusable and the dom0 kernel
would attempt to map this region and Xen does not permit unusable
regions to be mapped by guests.

(XEN)  0000000000000000 - 0000000000060000 (usable)
(XEN)  0000000000060000 - 0000000000068000 (reserved)
(XEN)  0000000000068000 - 000000000009e000 (usable)
(XEN)  0000000000100000 - 0000000000800000 (usable)
(XEN)  0000000000800000 - 0000000000972000 (unusable)

tboot marked this region as unusable.

(XEN)  0000000000972000 - 00000000cf200000 (usable)
