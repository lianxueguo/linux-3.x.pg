Subject: [PATCH 5/8] x86/xen: set regions above the end of RAM as 1:1

PCI devices may have BARs located above the end of RAM so mark such
frames as identity frames in the p2m (instead of the default of
missing).

PFNs outside the p2m (above MAX_P2M_PFN) are also considered to be
identity frames for the same reason.
